# Holbertonschool-ChatGPT-Introduction

This repository is part of the **Holberton School curriculum** and focuses on learning how to use **ChatGPT as a debugging and development assistant**.

The project demonstrates how AI tools can help identify bugs, fix logical errors, improve input validation, and document code effectively across multiple programming tasks.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project introduces **AI-assisted programming** through a series of debugging challenges written in **Python**, **HTML**, and **JavaScript**.

Each task presents broken or incomplete code that must be analyzed, corrected, tested, and documented using ChatGPT as a support tool.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will learn how to:

- Identify logical and runtime errors
- Prevent crashes caused by invalid user input
- Fix infinite loops and incorrect game logic
- Implement win and draw conditions in games
- Improve code robustness and readability
- Add clear documentation and comments
- Use ChatGPT effectively in a development workflow

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Git
- Python 3
- A code editor or IDE
- Basic command-line knowledge

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LenyBl/holbertonschool-chatgpt-introduction.git
cd holbertonschool-chatgpt-introduction
```

## 🧩 Project Content

The `debugging/` directory contains several scripts, including:

* **factorial.py**
  Fixes infinite loops, adds input validation, and documents functions.

* **print_arguments.py**
  Safely handles command-line arguments and execution permissions.

* **change_background.html**
  Fixes JavaScript event handling to dynamically change the page background.

* **mines.py**
  Implements a functional Minesweeper game with proper win detection.

* **checkbook.py**
  Adds error handling to prevent crashes from invalid user input.

* **tic_tac_toe.py**
  Fixes input validation, winner detection, and draw handling.

---

## 🧪 Testing

All scripts were tested using:

* Valid input
* Invalid and non-numeric input
* Out-of-range values
* Edge cases and unexpected user behavior

The goal was to ensure **correct behavior and no crashes**.
